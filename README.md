#FizzBuzz Game


##Makers Academy Week 2 Exercise


###Aim

The aim of this kata is to implement a FizzBuzz method. The method replaces any number divisible by 3 with 'Fizz', and number divisible by 5 with 'Buzz', and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'. Other numbers remain untouched.


###Task


```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.
```
